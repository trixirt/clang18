# Build/PR gating tests for *LLVM 13*
#
# Compatible with various LLVM 13 distributions:
#
#   * Fedora (ursine packages)
#   * Centos 9 stream (ursine packages)
#   * RHEL-9 (ursine packages)
#   * RHEL-8 (Red Hat module)
#   * RHEL-7 (software collection)

summary: Clang tests for build/PR gating
adjust:
  - because: "Plan to be ran when either executed locally, or executed by CI system to gate a build or PR."
    when: >-
      trigger is defined
      and trigger != commit
      and trigger != build
    enabled: false

  - because: "When testing SCL-ized LLVM, the collection must be enabled first"
    environment+:
      WITH_SCL: "scl enable llvm-toolset-13.0"
    when: "collection == llvm-toolset-13.0"
  - because: "When testing SCL-ized LLVM, the collection must be enabled first"
    environment+:
      WITH_SCL: "scl enable llvm-toolset-14.0"
    when: "collection == llvm-toolset-14.0"

  # Unfortunately, TMT does not support more declarative approach, we need to run commands on our own.

  # Unfortunatelly, TMT does not support more declarative approach, we need to run commands on our own.
